MARKOV MODEL MASHUPS

Creates 'lyrical mashups' using Markov Models.
Can use characters or words as state. (You should add more mediums!)

Example files used:
    mashup.py       # this script
    sonnets.txt     # all of shakespeare's sonnets
    rhcp.txt        # all of red hot chili peppers lyrics
    gaga.txt        # all of lady gaga's lyrics

Input:
    ./mashup.py sonnets.txt              # randomly generate text similar to
                                         # shakespeare's sonnets
    
    ./mashup.py sonnets.txt rhcp.txt     # mashup shakespeare and the RHCP

    ./mashup.py *.txt                    # mashup all three

    ./mashup.py mashup.py                # inception

Output:
    mashup of source documents
    adjust constants and main to fit your needs!
